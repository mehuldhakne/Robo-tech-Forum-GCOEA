                         <p>Robocon 2023 competition, held in Cambodia, involved teams from approximately 20 countries participating in the ABU Asia-Pacific Robot Contest. This year’s competition is conducted under the theme ”Casting Flowers Over Angkor Wat”. The theme revolved around robots performing tasks inspired by local culture, such as "Robots sprinkle flowers on Angkor Wat Temple" and "Robots toss rings at a pole". Teams designed and built autonomous robots to complete specific challenges, emphasizing collaboration and innovation. The event not only fostered friendly competition but also provided us with invaluable hands-on experience in robotics, programming, and engineering principles, contributing to our professional development and teamwork skills.
                             The ABU Robocon 2023 problem statement, involved two robots, a Rabbit Robot (RR) and an Elephant Robot (ER), working in coordination to toss rings onto poles, simulating "Casting Flowers Over Angkor Wat".

                   <h4>ROBOCON</h4>
                   <p>Robocon, short for Robotics Contest, is an annual international robotics competition organized by the Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union (ABU), where university teams design, build, and program autonomous and manually controlled robots to complete specific tasks based on a given theme. The competition promotes innovation, teamwork, and practical engineering skills by challenging participants with real-world robotics problems, often inspired by cultural or technological themes.
                    Each year, ABU Robocon releases detailed game rules that define the objectives, constraints, and scoring criteria. The competition typically involves two robots per team—one manually controlled and the other autonomous—tasked with navigating arenas, manipulating objects, or completing intricate sequences of actions within a time limit. Participants must optimize mechanical design, control systems, and algorithms to ensure efficiency, accuracy, and reliability. High-speed actuation, precise sensor integration, and robust communication protocols are critical for success.
                    In India, DD Robocon serves as the national qualifier for ABU Robocon and is organized by Doordarshan (DD) in collaboration with leading technical institutions. Indian teams compete to win the national championship and secure a spot in the international event. DD Robocon follows the same theme as ABU Robocon but serves as a platform for Indian teams to refine their designs before the global contest. It encourages interdisciplinary collaboration among students specializing in mechanical engineering, electronics, computer science, and robotics.
                    The competition pushes the limits of engineering by requiring teams to implement advanced control strategies such as PID controllers, machine vision for autonomous navigation, and AI-based decision-making. Wireless communication protocols, such as Zigbee, Bluetooth, or Wi-Fi, are often used for robot coordination, while actuators and high-torque motors drive precision movements. Teams must also consider material selection, power management, and modular design for rapid debugging and on-field adjustments.
                    Robocon has become a prestigious event that bridges academia and industry, providing students with invaluable experience in automation, robotics, and AI-driven systems. Winning teams gain international recognition, and many participants go on to contribute to advancements in robotics research, industrial automation, and autonomous systems development.

                    <p>In RTF, we have a completely separate domain for Aero and Aviation Technology. Members who are more enthusiastic about flying machines like RC Planes, drones, etc., are given a set of components and resources that suit them best to achieve their goals and create something they are truly passionate about. The Aero branch in RTF excels in every field, whether it be competitions, expos, or sessions organized by RTF. During introductory sessions for new RTF recruits, they are shown every plane and drone built in RTF to capture their interest in this field.</p>
                    
                    <h4>RC Planes</h4>
                    
                    <p>RC Planes are primarily used for small-scale testing before the actual manufacturing of real planes. A wide variety of RC Planes are built in RTF, including:</p>

                            <p>A Tail-Sitter Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) aircraft was designed to take off and land vertically while maintaining a horizontal flight position. This innovative design allowed for compact storage and operation in limited spaces. The tail-sitter featured unique propulsion systems that enabled a smooth transition between vertical and horizontal flight.</p>
                        </li>
                    
                        <li>

                            <p>The P-40 Warhawk was a classic WWII fighter plane known for its ruggedness and versatility. In RC form, it retained the iconic shark-mouth design and featured a wingspan of approximately 1.2m (47 in). The model was typically powered by an electric motor, providing speeds up to 80 km/h (50 mph). With its semi-symmetrical airfoil, the P-40 offered stable flight characteristics suitable for both novice and experienced pilots.</p>
                        </li>
                    
                        <li>

                            <p>The FT-Old Foggy was a popular RC trainer aircraft designed for beginners. It featured a high-wing configuration that enhanced stability during flight. With a wingspan of about 1.2m (48 in), this model was lightweight and easy to handle. Typically powered by an electric motor, the FT-Old Foggy was known for its slow flight capabilities, making it ideal for learning basic flying skills without the risk of rapid descent or stalling.</p>
